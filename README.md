# Fizz_TS

The aim of this exercise is to show a prospective employer my adaptability and willingness to learn new tech if the need arises. Given no previous experience in TypeScript, I wanted to show my approach to learning a new language. This involved translating the exercise from my more experienced skills in Ruby and Javascript.

The rules are:
```
Given a list of numbers from 1 to n.
If a number is divisible by 3 should be replaced with Fizz.
If a number is divisible by 5 should be replaced with Buzz.
If a number is divisible by 3 and by 5 should be replaced with FizzBuzz.
```
